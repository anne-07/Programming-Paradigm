# CAFE ORDERING SYSTEM
 The project involves creating a system for Espresso Express, an order management
 system for a caf√©. Designed and implemented a system where customers
 could add items to their orders, delete items, and view the final bill. The emphasis was on using
 inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading concepts of object oriented programming.
